# MAC - DISORDER: PTSD MED OBSESSIVE FEATURES

**Acquired:** Maj 2025 (Sea Glass operation, Breaking Point passed)  
**Type:** Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder med Obsessive-Compulsive features  
**Severity:** Moderate-to-Severe, deteriorating

---

## DIAGNOSIS

### Primary: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)

**Trauma sources:**
- Multiple combat exposures (Marines: Iraq, Afghanistan)
- Delta Green operations (Old Gods, Night Shift, Book Club)
- The Mall Before Christmas (14 civila döda, mission failure)
- **Sea Glass (breaking point):** Impossible choice, offer dog, Mac broke

**DSM-5 Criteria (all met):**
- ✓ Exposure to actual/threatened death (repeated, occupational)
- ✓ Intrusive memories (flashbacks, nightmares daily)
- ✓ Avoidance of trauma-related stimuli (malls, beaches, Maine)
- ✓ Negative alterations in mood/cognition (guilt, detachment, numbness)
- ✓ Marked alterations in arousal/reactivity (hypervigilance, aggression, sleep)
- ✓ Duration >1 month (4+ months sedan Sea Glass)
- ✓ Functional impairment (FBI forced leave, family deterioration, social isolation)

### Secondary: Obsessive-Compulsive Features

**NOT full OCD, but obsessive traits:**

**Obsessions:**
- Persistent intrusive thoughts om Volkov (24/7)
- Rumination över Sea Glass choice ("Gjorde jag rätt?")
- Fixation på kristaller, signal, patterns

**Compulsive-like behaviors:**
- Volkov research (daily habit men inte rigid ritual)
- Board updates (coping mechanism men flexible)
- Checking behaviors (locks, windows, gun)
- Pattern-finding (sometimes delusional)

**Key difference från OCD:**
Mac's behaviors är trauma-responses och coping mechanisms, inte true compulsions. Han CAN resist (svårt) men känner inte "something terrible will happen" om han inte följer dem.

## MANIFESTATIONS

### 1. INTRUSIVE MEMORIES (PTSD Core)

**Flashbacks (2-5 per vecka, mer under stress):**

- **End state:** Hypervigilance spike

**Warning signs flashback imminent:**
- Thousand-yard stare
- Stops mid-sentence
- Hands start shaking
- Breathing changes

**Recovery time:** 10-30 minuter efter major flashback

### 2. NIGHTMARES (Nightly)

**Sleep pattern:**
- Falls asleep: 23:00-01:00 (exhaustion)
- First nightmare: 02:00-03:00
- Wakes: Screaming eller gasping
- Can't return to sleep: 60% nights
- **Total sleep: 3-4 hours/natt**

**Standard nightmare rotation:**
1. Volkov escaping i slow motion (Mac can't pull trigger)
2. Jake med kristall growing från chest ("Why didn't you save me?")
3. Sea Glass offer, face frozen i terror, Mac forced att detonate
4. All 14 Mall victims staring at Mac (silent accusation)
5. Sarah saying "You're a monster" while Jake hides bakom her

**Coping (dysfunctional):**
- Whiskey before bed (doesn't help)
- Research till exhaustion (delays sleep)
- Avoids bedroom (sleeps on couch)

### 3. HYPERVIGILANCE (Always Active)

**Physical symptoms:**
- Cannot sit with back to door
- Scans room constantly för exits
- Checks faces för threats
- Startles at unexpected sounds
- Hands near weapon (even civilian settings)

**Exhaustion från constant arousal:**
- Muscles always tense (chronic pain)
- Headaches (daily)
- Elevated blood pressure
- Digestive issues
- Gets sick mer often (immune suppression)

**Impact på relationships:**
- Jake: "Pappa's always looking around"
- Sarah: "You can't relax, ever"
- Tom: "Son, you're wound tighter than a spring"
- Sullivan: "Mac, we're safe here" (Mac never believes it)

### 4. AVOIDANCE BEHAVIORS

**Places avoided:**
- Shopping malls (especially during holidays)
- Maine (can't return)
- Beaches vid dawn
- His bedroom (sleeps on couch, less vulnerable)

**People avoided:**
- Jake (guilt över being scary)
- Sarah (can't handle her disappointment)
- FBI colleagues (would see he's broken)
- Old Marine buddies (ashamed av what he became)

**Topics avoided:**
- Maine/Sea Glass (FBI-incident triggered by just hearing "Maine")
- Mall Before Christmas (can't talk about missing shot)
- Family future (no hope left)
- Mental health (acknowledging = admitting defeat)

### 5. VOLKOV OBSESSION (Obsessive Features)

**Intrusive thoughts:**
- "Where is he?" (50+ times/day)
- "He's planning something"
- "I need to find him NOW"
- "He's watching me"

**Frequency:** Constant baseline, intensifies under stress  
**Control:** Limited (Mac CAN redirect briefly, but thoughts return)

**Research behaviors (not true compulsions):**
- Daily dark web searches (habit)
- Board updates (coping mechanism)
- Pattern-finding (sometimes paranoid)
- Following leads (compelling but CAN resist med effort)

**The Board:**
- Cork board covered med lakan
- Photos, maps, printouts, red string
- "WHERE IS HE?" written 47 gånger
- Updates daily (flexible timing, not ritual)
- Stares at it för hours (seeking patterns)

**Key difference från OCD:**
Mac VILL desperately research Volkov.  
Mac doesn't feel "something bad will happen" om han skippar en dag.  
Men det är nearly impossible att resist (trauma-driven fixation).

### 6. KRISTALL HALLUCINATIONS

**Visual distortions:**
- Sees kristaller i reflections (glas, screens, water)
- Objects appear to "grow" kristaller
- People sometimes have kristaller i deras bodies (Mall/Sea Glass intrusion)

**Frequency:** 10-20 times/dag  
**Reality testing:** Mac KNOWS they're not real, can't stop seeing them  
**Worst times:** Night, exhaustion, high stress

**Not psychosis:**
Mac retains insight (vet det är hallucinations).  
Trauma-related, not loss av reality testing.

### 7. "SIGNAL" AUDITORY HALLUCINATIONS

**The Sound:**
- Pulsing hum från Sea Glass beacon
- Electronic interference patterns
- Sometimes hears "THE SIGNAL CALLS" (echo från drönare)

**Frequency:** Constant low-level baseline  
**Volume:** Ranges från barely noticeable → distracting  
**Control:** None (always there, like tinnitus)

**Impact:**
- Makes concentration harder
- Worsens under stress
- Reinforces trauma memories
- No escape från it

### 8. EMOTIONAL NUMBING & DETACHMENT

**Symptoms:**
- Difficulty feeling joy (anhedonia)
- Emotionally distant från loved ones
- Reduced interest i activities (except Volkov-jakt)
- Sense av foreshortened future ("Won't live long anyway")

**Jake's observation:** "Pappa tittar på mig men ser inte mig"

**Sarah's observation:** "There's nobody home bakom hans ögon anymore"

### 9. IRRITABILITY & ANGER

**Hair-trigger temper:**
- Snaps at minor things
- Explosive reactions till triggers
- Difficulty controlling anger
- Regret afterward (usually)

**FBI Incident (Augusti 2025):**
Colleague mentioned "Maine" casually.  
Mac exploded: "VAD VET DU OM MAINE?!"  
Total loss av control i professional setting.

**Pattern:**
Calm → Triggered → Explosion → Regret/Shame → Withdrawal

### 10. SUBSTANCE USE (Alcohol)

**Pattern:**
- Daily drinking (3-5 drinks baseline)
- Bad nights: 8-10 drinks
- Purpose: Numb signal, dull memories, force sleep
- Effect: Temporary relief, worsens everything long-term

**Progression:**
- Pre-Sea Glass: Social drinker
- Post-Sea Glass: Nightly ritual
- September 2025: Borderline dependency

**Warning signs:**
- Morning shakes (started Augusti)
- Hiding amount (lies about how much)
- Drinking alone (always)
- Needs it to "function"

### 11. GUILT & MORAL INJURY

**The Weight:**
- 14 civila deaths (Mall) - "My fault, missed shot"
- Sea Glass offer - "I killed honom, chose mission"
- Rodriguez (Afghanistan) - "Died in my arms"
- Santos/Dr. Grant (Old Gods) - "I led them där"
- Sarah/Jake - "Destroyed my family"

**Manifests as:**
- Self-blame (constant)
- Worthlessness feelings
- Suicidal ideation (passive: "World better off")
- Reckless behavior (doesn't care if dies)

## FUNCTIONAL IMPAIRMENTS

### Work (FBI)

**Current status:** Forced leave (Augusti 2025)

**Can he return?** Unlikely utan treatment

**Why:**
- Can't focus on non-Volkov cases
- Hypervigilance → aggression i interviews
- Flashbacks during briefings
- "Maine incident" = major red flag
- Paranoia affecting judgment

### Delta Green Operations

**Strengths remaining:**
- Tactical skills intact (muscle memory)
- Shooting ability unchanged
- Combat experience valuable
- Fearlessness (doesn't care if dies = dangerous asset)

**Impairments:**
- Judgment compromised (Volkov-focus overrides rationality)
- Team trust issues (paranoia developing)
- Risk-taking extreme (reckless)
- Following orders harder (questions everything)
- Triggers can disable honom mid-mission

**Cardinal's assessment:** "1-2 operations från permanent retirement"

### Family Relationships

**Sarah (Bond 8/12):** Damaged, deteriorating
- She sees he's broken
- Wants to help, doesn't know how
- Protecting Jake från Mac
- Considering restraining order if worsens

**Jake (Bond 8/12):** Distant, scared
- "Pappa är läskig"
- Stops calling/texting
- Prefers mamma's house
- Starting att give up

**Tom (Bond 10/12):** Holding steady, worried
- Recognizes combat PTSD
- Fishing trips temporary relief
- Won't give up men preparing för worst
- "Son, you need professional help"

### Daily Functioning

**Sleep:** 3-4 hours/night (insufficient)  
**Nutrition:** Poor (forgets to eat, takeout)  
**Hygiene:** Adequate but declining  
**Exercise:** Gym daily (obsessive, outlet för rage)  
**Social:** Isolated (avoids everyone except Sullivan occasionally)  
**Apartment:** Disaster (empty bottles, Volkov-board, unwashed dishes)

---

## COPING MECHANISMS

### FUNCTIONAL (Somewhat)

**Physical exercise (Gym):**
- 2 hours daily, heavy weights
- Exhausts body, slight mental relief
- **Risk:** Overtraining, injury
- **Effectiveness:** 40% (temporary)

**Fishing med Tom:**
- Grounding, connection till normalcy
- Can't do often enough (monthly)
- Tom's presence calming
- **Effectiveness:** 60% (while there, wears off)

**Sullivan conversations:**
- Sharing burden med someone who understands
- Sullivan's presence stabilizing
- "Du är inte ensam, Mac"
- **Effectiveness:** 50% (dependent på Sullivan's state)

**Volkov research (Paradox):**
- Feels productive
- Gives sense av control/purpose
- **BUT:** Reinforces obsession, prevents healing
- **Effectiveness:** -20% (makes worse long-term)

### DYSFUNCTIONAL (Majority)

**Alcohol:**
- Immediate relief från intrusive thoughts
- **BUT:** Worsens sleep, anxiety, health, dependency developing
- **Effectiveness:** 30% immediate, -50% overall

**Isolation/Avoidance:**
- "Protecting" others från himself
- **BUT:** Prevents support, deepens depression, reinforces fears
- **Effectiveness:** -40%

**Obsessive Volkov-focus:**
- Misdirects från processing trauma
- False sense av purpose
- **BUT:** Prevents healing, drives deterioration
- **Effectiveness:** -60%

**Denial:**
- "I'm fine, just tired"
- Refuses professional help, medication, evaluation
- **Effectiveness:** -80% (delays treatment, accelerates decline)

### NOT ATTEMPTED (Needed)

- Professional trauma therapy (EMDR, CPT)
- SSRI medication
- Sleep aids
- Support groups (impossible given Delta Green secrets)
- Healthy sleep hygiene

## GAMEPLAY MECHANICS

### SAN Checks - Modified Frequency

**Standard scenario triggers:**
Normal SAN checks as written

**Disorder-specific extra checks:**
- Kristaller/red glass: 0/1 per encounter
- Screaming children: 1/1d6
- Beaches: 1/1d6
- Russian language: 0/1d4
- Malls: 1/1d4
- Water/ocean: 0/1d4
- Snow: 1/1d4

**Failed check results:**
- **Minor (0-1 loss):** Flashback, distraction, -20% next roll
- **Moderate (2-4 loss):** Major flashback, can't act 1d6 rounds
- **Major (5+ loss):** Breakdown, violent outburst, eller catatonic
- **Fumble:** Second break risk

### Functional Penalties (Current)

**Always active:**
- Alertness: +20% (hypervigilance) BUT -20% från fatigue (nets 0%)
- HUMINT: -10% (paranoia clouds judgment)
- Persuade: -20% (aggressive, impatient)

**When triggered (during flashback):**
- ALL skills: -40% för 1d10 minutes
- Combat skills: Unchanged (muscle memory) UNLESS freeze response
- Social skills: -60% if trigger active during interaction

**When exhausted (common):**
- All mental skills: -10%
- Physical skills: -5%
- Cumulative med other penalties

### Volkov-Obsession Mechanics

**When Volkov mentioned/lead found:**

Mac WANTS desperately att investigate.

**Resistance check:** POW × 3% (currently 36%)

**Success:** Mac can delay/resist (men uncomfortable, distracted)  
**Failure:** Mac MUST pursue lead (can't focus on annat)  
**Critical fail:** Mac abandons current task immediately

**Sullivan can talk Mac down:** CHA × 5% check från Sullivan

### Complications During Operations

**Kristall presence:**
- -20% mental resistance checks
- Hallucinations intensify
- Risk av freeze response (POW check)
- Sees patterns/connections that aren't real

**Impossible choice scenario (Sea Glass echo):**
- Automatic trigger
- Must make SAN check eller freeze/breakdown
- If passes: Can act, men haunted afterward
- If fails: Relives Sea Glass, incapacitated 1d10 minutes

**Team trust situations:**
- Paranoia makes Mac question teammates
- May suspect infiltration/betrayal
- Sullivan can stabilize (CHA check)
- Sparky's tech occasionally triggers suspicion

**Mission failure:**
- Major trigger (Sea Glass/Mall echo)
- SAN check 0/1d4
- If fails: Rage, self-blame, reckless behavior
- Volkov-obsession intensifies

---

## SECOND BREAK - What Happens?

**Current status:**
- SAN: 30/60
- Breaking Point: 24
- **Margin: 6 points**

**If Mac loses 7+ SAN i single event:**
Second break triggered.

**Possible outcomes (SL choice eller roll):**

1. **Catatonic Shutdown (20%):**
   - Mac completely shuts down
   - Non-responsive, can't function
   - Requires hospitalization
   - Unplayable

2. **Psychotic Break (25%):**
   - Loses touch med reality
   - Full paranoia, everyone är enemy
   - Sees kristaller everywhere as real
   - Dangerous till team
   - Requires restraint/sedation

3. **Violent Outburst (20%):**
   - Attacks perceived threat (could be ally)
   - Uncontrolled rage
   - Potential casualties
   - Must be subdued

4. **Suicide Attempt (15%):**
   - Sees no way out
   - Active ideation becomes action
   - Team must intervene
   - Survival uncertain

5. **Total Volkov Delusion (20%):**
   - Becomes entirely consumed
   - Can't distinguish Volkov från reality
   - Sees honom everywhere
   - Reckless pursuit regardless av consequences
   - May go rogue

**Game impact:**
Mac becomes unplayable character OR drastically changed (NPC/antagonist possibility).

**Jonas would need:**
- New character
- OR Mac becomes NPC (broken, retired)
- OR Mac's final arc (heroic death/sacrifice)

---

## RECOVERY - Possible?

**Short answer:** Yes, BUT Mac refuses treatment.

**What would actually help:**

**Therapy:**
- EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing)
- CPT (Cognitive Processing Therapy)
- Prolonged Exposure therapy
- **Timeline:** 6-12 months intensive

**Medication:**
- SSRI (Sertraline, Paroxetine)
- Sleep aids (Prazosin för nightmares)
- Anti-anxiety (as needed)
- **Timeline:** 4-8 weeks för effect

**Lifestyle:**
- Stop drinking
- Regular sleep schedule
- Healthy nutrition
- Reduce stress
- **Timeline:** Immediate start, ongoing

**Support:**
- Family reconnection
- Peer support (impossible given DG secrets)
- Handler support (Cardinal trying)
- **Timeline:** Ongoing

**Closure:**
- **Finding Volkov** (risky men potentially helpful)
- Processing Sea Glass trauma
- Accepting Mall failure
- **Timeline:** Varies

**Realistic full recovery:** 18-24 months minimum

**Mac will never be "samma" as before.**

**Mac's actual trajectory:**
- Treatment: ZERO (refuses all)
- Recovery: Not happening
- Prognosis: Poor without intervention
- Likely outcome: Continued deterioration

---

## TRIP 19 IMPACT

**Potential outcomes:**

### If Mac finds Volkov (success):
- **Best case:** Closure begins healing process, obsession releases
- **Realistic:** Some relief, men trauma remains
- **Risk:** Volkov escapes AGAIN = definite second break

### If Mac finds answers (partial success):
- Some closure (why Flight 19, what Volkov wanted)
- Obsession slightly reduced
- Trauma remains, men purpose achieved
- Possible stabilization (not recovery, just stopped deteriorating)

### If Mac fails (no answers):
- Frustration intensifies
- Obsession worsens
- Continued deterioration
- Second break likely within months

### If Mac has major trauma on mission:
- Second break possible during mission
- Could happen mid-operation (dangerous för team)
- May require emergency extraction
- Cardinal's nightmare scenario

---

## NOTES FÖR JONAS (Player)

### Playing the Disorder

**Subtlety är key:**
- Don't announce "Mac flashbacks now"
- Just pause, stare, describe what Mac sees
- Let others notice something's wrong

**Physical tells:**
- Hands shaking when triggered
- Thousand-yard stare
- Checking exits reflexively
- Zoning out mid-conversation

**Volkov-obsession:**
- When mentioned: Mac's attention laser-focuses
- Can't help but follow leads (resist checks required)
- Board updates described casually
- Research habits shown not told

**Functional moments:**
- Mac CAN be effective operative
- Tactical skills intact
- Not "broken all the time"
- But cracks show under pressure

**Triggers:**
- When scenario includes triggers, roleplay response
- Ask SL: "Mac sees kristaller i reflection, SAN check?"
- Physical reaction before mental (body remembers)

**Team dynamics:**
- Mac leans på Sullivan (shows weakness with him)
- Enables Sparky's obsession (bonding över Volkov)
- Tries to hide från Cardinal (doesn't want retirement)

### When to Break (Second Time)

**Appropriate moments:**
- Major SAN loss event (7+ points)
- Volkov escapes again (ultimate failure)
- Team member dies (Mac's fault)
- Narrative climax (heroic sacrifice possible)

**Not appropriate:**
- Random bad roll
- Minor setback
- Early in campaign (waste av character development)

**After second break:**
- Discuss med SL: New character? Mac's final scene? NPC?
- Could be powerful story conclusion
- Or tragic end

---

## CARDINAL'S ASSESSMENT (SL Reference)

"Riley's PTSD is severe, exacerbated by obsessive Volkov-fixation. He's functional when not triggered, but triggers are everywhere now.

The obsession gives him purpose, which prevents total collapse. But it also prevents healing.

Paradox: Volkov-jakt keeps honom alive. And also kills honom slowly.

If he finds Volkov: Maybe closure. Maybe not.

If he doesn't: Second break within 6 months, guaranteed.

I'm watching my friend die. And I can't stop it. Because he won't let me."
