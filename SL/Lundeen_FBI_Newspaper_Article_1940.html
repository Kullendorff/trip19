            Isolationist Lundeen Under Investigation at Time of Fatal Crash<br>
            FBI Agents on Flight 19 When Plane Went Down
        </div>
        
        <div class="article-body">
            <div class="lede">
                If Federal authorities probe deep enough into the crash of the Pennsylvania Central Airlines plane which carried Senator Lundeen to his death in Virginia, they may find some highly interesting facts regarding Nazi activities in the United States.
            </div>
            
            <p class="paragraph">
                What most people do not know is that <span class="highlight">Senator Lundeen was under investigation at the time of his death.</span>
            </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph">
                <span class="highlight">A G-Man [meaning an FBI agent], a Department of Justice attorney, and an FBI secretary were on the plane with him, and all were killed</span> when the aircraft plunged into an alfalfa field near Lovettsville, Virginia, on August 31st.
            </p>
            
            <div class="pullquote">
                "Whether certain foreign agents figured that they were about to be exposed, whether G-men on the plane tangled with Lundeen on the flight, or whether it was an act of God and the weather may never be known."
            </div>
            
            <p class="paragraph">
                Suspicion had been directed in Senator Lundeen's direction after many mysterious visits to his office on the part of George Sylvester Viereck, famous German propagandist and a self-avowed "friend of Adolf Hitler's Germany."
            </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph">
                Viereck has been a frequent visitor to Lundeen's office, according to sources close to the investigation, to inquire if certain speeches — <span class="highlight">which had a pro-dictatorship slant</span> — had been inserted in the Congressional Record by Lundeen and his staff.
            </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph">
                The FBI was reportedly trying to find out "the extent to which Berlin was definitely hooked up" with the isolationist bloc in the Senate. Senator Lundeen had been one of the most vocal opponents of American intervention in the European war, and his speeches were described by investigators as "bitterly anti-British and vigorously against American preparedness."
            </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph">
                In March of this year, Senator Lundeen delivered a speech beneath a giant Nazi swastika banner at a white-tie dinner in New York City, hosted by the German-American Commerce Board. Present on the platform with him were several German officials and Duke Carl Eduard, a special emissary of Adolf Hitler.
            </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph">
                "It is our duty to cultivate friendly, cordial relations with the great German Reich and its people," Lundeen told the assembled guests, according to a copy of the speech obtained by this reporter.
            </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph">
                On the morning of August 31st — the day of the crash — Senator Lundeen's secretary, Harriet Johnson, arrived at his Capitol Hill office to find the Senator already there, which was unusual. According to sources, <span class="highlight">the Senator appeared distraught and told Miss Johnson that he had "gone too far"</span> with something, though he did not elaborate.
            </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph">
                He told his secretary he needed to return to Minneapolis urgently to speak with his wife about matters "she did not yet know about." Miss Johnson drove the Senator to the Washington-Hoover Airport, where he boarded Pennsylvania Central Airlines Flight 19.
            </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph">
                Several witnesses at the airport reported seeing what appeared to be <span class="highlight">a "struggle" or "disturbance" aboard the aircraft</span> just before takeoff, in which Senator Lundeen and several other passengers appeared to be involved. The nature of this incident has not been officially confirmed.
            </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph">
                The plane crashed approximately ten minutes after takeoff, during a violent thunderstorm. All 25 persons aboard were killed instantly. The Civil Aeronautics Board has attributed the crash to "extraordinary lightning effects," though their investigation acknowledged numerous unexplained aspects of the accident.
            </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph">
                The three Justice Department employees killed in the crash were:
            </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph" style="margin-left: 40px;">
                • <strong>Joseph J. Pesci</strong>, Special Agent, Federal Bureau of Investigation, from Blairsville, Pennsylvania<br>
                • <strong>Margaret Turner</strong>, Secretary, Federal Bureau of Investigation, from Huddleston, Virginia<br>
                • <strong>William Garbose</strong>, Attorney, Criminal Division, Department of Justice, from Washington, D.C.
            </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph">
                FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover has officially denied that the Bureau had Senator Lundeen under surveillance, stating that the presence of FBI personnel on the flight was "purely coincidental" and related to "other investigative matters."
            </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph">
                However, sources within the Justice Department suggest that the investigation into Senator Lundeen's activities — and his connections to German agents operating within the United States — was very much active at the time of his death.
            </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph">
                Senator Lundeen was buried with full military honors at Fort Snelling National Cemetery in Minnesota on September 9th. Political leaders from both parties attended the funeral and praised his service to the nation.
            </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph">
                <span class="highlight">Whether certain foreign agents figured that they were about to be exposed, whether G-men on the plane tangled with Lundeen on the flight, or whether it was an act of God and the weather may never be known.</span>
            </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph">
                The investigation into both the crash and Senator Lundeen's alleged connections to Nazi Germany continues, according to Justice Department sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.
            </p>
